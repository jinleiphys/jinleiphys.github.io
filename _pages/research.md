Our research group focuses on using quantum few-body models to study the structure and reactions of atomic nuclei, with particular emphasis on weakly bound nuclei. These nuclei play a crucial role in understanding fundamental nuclear forces and the stability of atomic structures. More details can be found at our group website: [QFBD Research Group](http://www.fewbody.com/research).

## Inclusive Breakup and the IAV Model

Our group has extensively studied nuclear reaction processes using a quantum three-body model, treating the projectile as a weakly bound two-body system. We focus on inclusive breakup reactions --- where only one fragment of the projectile is detected after collision --- using the Ichimura-Austern-Vincent (IAV) model. With this framework, we have successfully studied fusion and incomplete fusion processes in reactions induced by weakly bound nuclei such as deuterons and <sup>6</sup>Li.

## CDCC with Ab-initio Structure Calculations

In the Continuum Discretized Coupled Channels (CDCC) method, projectiles such as <sup>6</sup>Li are traditionally described as an alpha + deuteron structure bound by a simple Woods-Saxon potential. We are working toward a full ab-initio treatment of the internal structure of these clusters, considering all internal degrees of freedom to achieve a more realistic description of nuclear reactions.

## Dynamics of Four-Body Systems

We are investigating four-body breakup processes. Given the known challenges in handling three charged particles within the Faddeev framework, we aim to perform four-body breakup calculations for systems with four charged particles using a Distorted Wave Born Approximation (DWBA) framework, treating the projectile as having a three-body structure.

## Resonance Decay Processes

Starting from two-body decay scenarios such as alpha decay, we model the alpha and daughter nuclei within a two-body framework. Our research extends to more complex systems including three-body decays (such as two-proton decay) and potentially five-body decays (alpha decay in a five-body model).

## Surrogate Reactions

Surrogate reactions are indirect methods used to study nuclear reactions that are difficult to measure directly, particularly those involving unstable, radioactive nuclei. Our study of inclusive breakup using the IAV model has proposed a promising pathway to fully describe surrogate reactions. We continue to develop this approach for applications in nuclear astrophysics and stockpile stewardship.
