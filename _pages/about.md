I was born and reared in the city of Shenyang, China, where I went on to complete my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University (China), my graduate studies at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and my doctoral research in physics at the Universidad de Sevilla (2016). I did my postdoctoral work in nuclear physics at both Ohio University in Athens, Ohio (2016-2019) and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Pisa in Pisa, Italy (2019-2020). My present affiliation is with Tongji University in Shanghai, China, where I am a professor.

To that end, I have focused my studies on questions related to nuclear reactions. In the course of my study, I have examined a wide range of phenomena associated with nuclear reactions, beginning with systematic examinations of the behavior of nuclear reaction observables. I've looked into using the Faddeev equations to model nuclear reactions, and I've also studied quantum three-body problems. By looking into the causes of optical potential errors, I was able to gain a deeper appreciation for the margins of error inherent in theoretical calculations. In order to better comprehend fusion and incomplete fusion of weakly bound projectile-induced reactions, I implemented the inclusive breakup model into nuclear reaction systems.

To put it simply, I enjoy being a teacher. It is said that "Teaching and Learning Encourage Each Other" in traditional Chinese. Inquisitiveness, explanations, and doubts on the part of students push me to expand my knowledge. There needs to be communication on both ends.

I have four beautiful kitties, and when I'm not doing research, I enjoy live-streaming video games, reading, hiking, cooking, and watching movies.

Outside of academia, "Happy Wife, Happy Life" is my favorite saying.
