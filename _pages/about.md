I was born and raised in Shenyang, China. I completed my undergraduate studies at Northeastern University in China, my graduate studies at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and earned my PhD in physics from Universidad de Sevilla (2016). I pursued postdoctoral work in nuclear physics at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio (2016-2019) and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Pisa in Pisa, Italy (2019-2020). I am currently a professor at Tongji University in Shanghai, China.

My studies have focused on nuclear reactions, and I have explored a range of phenomena associated with these reactions, including systematic examinations of nuclear reaction observables. I have also used Faddeev equations and studied quantum three-body problems. By investigating the causes of optical potential errors, I gained a deeper understanding of the margins of error inherent in theoretical calculations. In order to better understand fusion and incomplete fusion of weakly bound projectile-induced reactions, I incorporated the inclusive breakup model into nuclear reaction systems.

In addition to my research, I greatly enjoy teaching. In traditional Chinese, it is said that "Teaching and Learning Encourage Each Other." The curiosity, questions, and doubts of my students spur me to expand my knowledge, and communication is key.

On a personal note, I have four beautiful cats, and enjoy live-streaming video games, reading, hiking, cooking, and watching movies.

My favorite saying outside of academia is "Happy Wife, Happy Life."
