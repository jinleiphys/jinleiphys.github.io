Born and raised in Shenyang, China, I earned my Bachelor's degree at the Northeastern University (China), my Master's degree at University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and my Ph. D. degree in physics from Universidad de Sevilla (2016). My postdoctoral studies were at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio (2016-2019) and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Sezione di Pisa in Pisa, Italy (2019-2020). I am currently a research fellow at Tongji University in Shanghai, China.

My research focus on the topics of nuclear reaction. Beginning with the systematically studies of the behavior of nuclear reaction observables, my research has covered many phenomena that occur in nuclear reactions. My research has included the investigation of quantum three-body problems as well as the application of the Faddeev equations to nuclear reactions. Investigations of errors in optical potentials led me to better understanding the uncertainties in theoretical calculations. I applied the inclusive breakup model into nuclear reactions systems and made use it to gain better understanding of fusion and incomplete fusion of weakly bound projectile induced reactions.


I love teaching. There is an old Chinese saying "Teaching and Learning Promote Each Other''.  Students make me learn more and more with their questions, answers, and doubts. It is a two-way street.

When not involved in science, my obsessions include cat (I have two lovely cats), video game live streaming, reading, hiking, cooking and films.

My favorite quote outside of science: "Happy Wife, Happy Life''.
