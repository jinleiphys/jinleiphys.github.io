For the special time period of COVID-19, we would like to organize a series of online seminars that everybody can join. The seminars will cover all fields of nuclear reaction with special emphasis on the description and interpretation of different types of direct reactions: elastic/inelastic scattering, breakup, quasi-free (p,pN) processes, charge-exchange, â€¦
