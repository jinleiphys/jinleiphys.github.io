From February 2022, I started teaching Atomic Physics at Tongji University. 
Atomic Physics is a fascinating branch of physics that investigates the 
behavior and properties of atoms. This field plays a crucial role in several 
scientific and technological disciplines, including materials science, 
chemistry, and medical imaging. In this undergraduate course, you will 
learn about the fundamental principles of atomic physics, including atomic 
structure, quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, and interactions. You will also 
explore the practical applications of atomic physics in science and engineering. 
By the end of this course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the 
building blocks of matter and the essential role they play in our world.

The topics includes

* Quantum states of atoms: Bohr model, material can be found <a href="/teaching/AtomicPhysics_Chapter2.pdf"> here</a>

* Introduction to quantum mechanics, material can be found <a href="/teaching/AtomicPhysics_Chapter3.pdf"> here</a>
